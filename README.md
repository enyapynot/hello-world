# hello-world
Somewhere to start.

So. I'm following the instructions from: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/. I use github at work but so far nothing is new. However along the way I'm sure I'll find new stuff. For example I have holes in my understanding of branch merges and pull requests. I hope so. Or perhaps we just use it in a confusing way!. :-)
